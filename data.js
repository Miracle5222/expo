    h1: `Programming (or coding) is writing software (computer programs or code). It involves describing processes and/or procedures (algorithms), that is, the steps it takes to do something.`,
    h2: `In computer programming, these processes/procedures are specified into detailed lists of instructions – what is called the source code representation of software (Haas, 2016). This code or program comes in a variety of languages. A computer programming language, when compared to natural languages which man uses, simply serves to “bridge the gap between something the computer can understand (binary) and something that humans can understand, and are capable of crafting programs with”. (Foord, n.d.) The most common classification of computer languages is that of high-level and low level, where the levels are, of course, relative.`,
